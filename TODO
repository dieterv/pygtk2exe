* Auto-detection of the gtk+ runtime location from PATH could use some improvements:
    > use distutils.spanw.find_executable() ?
    > ???

* Provide a "filter", so it becomes possible to filter out for example
  share/locale/whetever_languages_we_dont_need.
    > regex or glob?
    > inclusive, exclusive or both?
    > reject filters for bin/ etc/ and lib/ or trust people to not abuse this?
