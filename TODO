* Looks like gtk.pyd needs cairo.pyd either as a type 4 or 5 dependency (see
  http://www.dependencywalker.com/help/html/dependency_types.htm). py2exe's
  modulefinder does not pick that up (and neither does dependency walker).
  Either hardcode such dependencies in pygtk2exe or figure out if it's possible
  to make those implicit or delay load dependencies instead...

* Add proper .exe.manifest files to the examples (or investigate if py2exe can generate one...)

* Auto-detection of the gtk+ runtime location from PATH could use some improvements:
    > use distutils.spanw.find_executable() ?
    > ???

* Not sure yet about py2exe options. I'm strongly leaning towards giving pygtk2exe
  complete control over this dict, limiting py2exe to a "known good configuration".
  Especially viewing how much incomplete and erroneous information has been spread
  in the past... We could then add support for more "exotic" options if there's
  sufficient interest and it's proven to work. Hey, maybe we can even gain extra
  contributors this way :)

    > If we decide to do this, we need to pass useful options from pygtk2exe to
      py2exe. An incomplete list: dist_dir, includes, packages, ???

* Provide a "filter", so it becomes possible to filter out for example
  share/locale/whetever_languages_we_dont_need.
    > regex or glob?
    > inclusive, exclusive or both?
    > reject filters for bin/ etc/ and lib/ or trust people to not abuse this?

* Maybe extend the "clean" command to do the equivalent of rm -rf build/* && rm -rf dist/*.
  Not doing this sometimes leads to subtle bugs when writing a setup.py file that
  uses py2exe.
