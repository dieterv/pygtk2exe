This is a complex example that shows how you can build an application suite
that consists of two Windows targets (bar.exe and foo.exe) and a Console
target (cli.exe) that uses a Python c Extension (_cli.pyd).

To get this example working, you'll either need to:
    - run this example from an MSys bash console with a
      working MinGW gcc (this is the default)
    - reconfigure setup.cfg to use some Microsoft compiler

Then simply execute:
$ python setup.py clean --all py2exe
