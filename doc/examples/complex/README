This is a complex example that shows how you can build an application suite
that consists of two WindowsApplication targets (bar.exe and foo.exe) and a
ConsoleApplication target (cli.exe) that uses a Python c Extension (_cli.pyd).

To get this example working, you'll either need to:
    - run this example from a working msys bash console (this is the default)
    - reconfigure setup.cfg to use some microsoft compiler
